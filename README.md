#Cuadratic

Cuadratic is an iOS app for Foursquare venue managers to search, bookmark and manage venues and view venue analytics.

The app uses [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to search for venues given a keyword and/or location and to display managed venues based on the entitlements of the logged in user.

Venue statistics provide total checkins, social media impact, demographics and user and hour breakdowns.

####Dependencies
Cuadratic uses the following dependencies:

- [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/ios-api/start): to provide autocomplete suggestions for places and location in search.
- [Font Awesome](https://github.com/thii/FontAwesome.swift): to display icons in the app.
- [iOS-charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts): to display statistics breakdown.

####Installation and usage
The app uses CocoaPods to install some of the dependencies, you need to have CocoaPods installed before running the app.

If you need to install CocoaPods, follow instructions [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

```
git clone https://github.com/ricardo-hdz/cuadratic.git
pod install
Open project: cuadratic.xcworkspace
```
Run it and sign it using your Foursquare credentials.

**Important**
Xcode project should be opened using cuadratic.xcworkspace in order to pick up the CocoaPod dependencies correctly.

####Notes
#####Stub Data
As this app is intended for Foursquare's venue users/managers, some of the  data to run/debug it is stub data as venue analytics and other information is only available to authorized venue managers.

If you are an authorized venue manager, you can switch on/off stub data in the AppDelegate file:

`var simulate: Bool = true`

To enable stub data, set the variable to true. To disable, set it to false.

#####Location Services
This app uses location services to automatically detect location and use it to perform venue searches. While debugging, you can set a custom location to simulate user's location. To do that, follow these steps:

- Go to Product menu > Scheme
- Select Edit Scheme
- Select Run/Debug in the left column options
- Select on Options menu
- Check "Allow Location Simulation" as set a Default Location from the dropdown
